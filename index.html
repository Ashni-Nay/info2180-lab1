 <p>I am a student at the University of the West Indies doing a Computer Science major and Statistics minor. I am an asipiring Forensic Computer Analyst.
 As a person who is a problem solver, and constantly evolving, it is important that I am able to learn and advance in my career instead of being interested
 in one thing. But, if we are being honest, it;s really about the money</p>
