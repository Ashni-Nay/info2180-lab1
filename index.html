 <h2>Ashni-Nay Wilson</h2>
 <p>I am curently a student of the UWI, Mona pursing a Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science and Statistics. 
 I am also an asipiring Forensic Computer Analyst. I see myself as someone who is a problem solver, and constantly evolving. With that said, I became interested
 in web development when I figured out the additional money I could make having this skill. But really, it was when I decided I needed to be a well rounded 
 computer analyst. </p>
